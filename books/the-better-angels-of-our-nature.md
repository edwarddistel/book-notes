# The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined

(2011)

By Steven Pinker

## About the author

Steven Pinker is oe of America's leading public intellectuals.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pinker):

>  Pinker is a Canadian-American cognitive psychologist, linguist, and popular science author. He is an advocate of evolutionary psychology and the computational theory of mind.

> Pinker's academic specializations are visual cognition and psycholinguistics. His experimental subjects include mental imagery, shape recognition, visual attention, children's language development, regular and irregular phenomena in language, the neural bases of words and grammar, and the psychology of cooperation and communication, including euphemism, innuendo, emotional expression, and common knowledge. He has written two technical books that proposed a general theory of language acquisition and applied it to children's learning of verbs. In particular, his work with Alan Prince published in 1989 critiqued the connectionist model of how children acquire the past tense of English verbs, arguing instead that children use default rules such as adding "-ed" to make regular forms, sometimes in error, but are obliged to learn irregular forms one by one.

# Initial reaction

Clocking in at 696 pages, this information-dense, chart-heavy 2011 look at the decline of violence in human history is probably one of the most important works of nonfiction in the past 30 years. 

It's definitely not the first book to note the decline of violence but possibly the most comprehensive, surveying the work of dozens of academic fields, hundreds of scholarly books and articles all while writing in a vivid, conversational tone that never feels condescending or wonky.

# The numbers on the decline in violence

The title itself might come as a shock to most people -- considering world wars, the Holocaust, genocides and other horrors one might assume that the 21st century or at least the 20th cenutry might have been the bloodiest in human history.

You'd be wrong.

By a lot.

A breakdown of the numbers:

> [Two new data sets] conservatively list about 40 million battle deaths during the 20th cenutry...If we consider that a bit more than 6 billion people died during the 20th century...we may estimate that around 0.7 percent of the world's population died in battles during that century. Even if we tripled or quadrupled the estimate to include indirect deaths from war-caused famine and disease, it would barely narrow the gap between state and nonstate societies. What if we added the deaths from genocides, purges and other man-made disasters? Matthew White, the atrocitologist we met in chapter 1, estimates that around 80 million deaths can be blamed on all of these human causes put together. That still amounts to only 3 percent of the deaths in the 20th century. (p. 50)

For hunter-gatherers the rate is around 13.4 percent, for city-dwellers before the modern era it was 2.7 percent.

For present day? Pinker estimates it's at a rate of 0.0003 percent.

As Pinker is quick to point out, the major difference maker is the state, which he calls "the Leviathian" (borrowing from 16th C English philosophy Thomas Hobbes), a theoretically neutral third party can establish justice and eliminate threats in the society.

# Why violence occurs

Pinker identifies three causes of violence:

1. Gain (predatory raids)
1. Safety (preemptive raids)
1. Reputation (retalitory raids)

The first two, Pinker argues are typically perpetrated by state actors, but as modern wealth tends to be accrued not through occupying physical territory but through trade and the production of advanced goods and services, land wars become nonsensical, almost defeatist, since they destroy the modern means of wealth creation (people and economies).

# The Civilizing Process - How violence has declined

Through what process has violence declined? Presumably people just didn't lay down their knives and guns one day.

Pinker relies heavily on the 1969 work of Norbert Elias *The Civilizing Process*. Elias, a Polish-German Jew who escaped the Holocaust, was the first major author to note the trend in the decline in violence in human history. Pinker writes:

> Elias's theory, then, attributes the decline in European violence to a larger psychological change...He proposed that over a span of several centuries, beginning in the 11th or 12th and maturing in the 17th and 18th, Europeans increasingly inhibited their impulses, anticipated the long-term consequences of their actions, and took other people's thoughts and feelings into consideration. A culture of honor...gave way to a culture of dignity...These ideals originated in explicit instructions that cultural arbiters gave to aristocrats and noblemen, allowing them to differentiate themsleves from the villains and boors. But they were then absorbed into the socialization of younger and younger children until they became second nature. The standards also trickled down from the upper classes to the bourgeoisie that strove to emulate them, and from them to the lower classes, eventually becoming a part of the culture as a whole. (p. 72)

To break out two components of that argument: the state and the nobility.

The state has a vested interest in decreasing violence between its subjects because it's a loss of economic activity and potential military strength. Since the middle ages states became increasingly larger and more powerful, and their ability to inhibit violence was enhanced.

The second trigger Pinker draws from Elias is "gentle commerce", as medieval societies evolved from serfdom toward modern commerce the incentives for violence decreased -- similar to the argument that the U.S. and China are unlikely to ever fight a war because of their profound economic interdependence.

He writes:

> The two civilizing forces, then, reinforce each other...The centralization of state control and its monopolization of violence, the growth of craft guilds and bureaucracies, the replacement of barter with money, the development of technology, the enhancement of trade...And to prosper within that whole, one had to cultivate faculties of empathy and self-control until they became, as he put it, second nature. (p. 78)

The empathy and self-control arguments loom large later in the book but I'm not convinced they were prerequisites to financial success in an evolving capitalist system -- it seems obvious to note there are hundreds of famous examples of ruthless and unempathetic people without much self-control who became fabulously wealthy in such systems.

# Violence and poverty

He also notes that the upper-class used to be as violent as the lower class (quoting several manners guides that recommended boxing and fighting others) but now violence is largely associated with poverty:

> The main reason that violence correlates with low socioeconomic status today is that the elites and the middle class pursue justice with the legal system while the lower classes reosrt to what scholars of violence call "self-help"...it is another name for vigilantism, fronier justice, taking the law into your own hands (p. 83)

He cites legal scholar Donald Black's statistic that as few as 10 percent of homicides are a means to an end (killing a homeowner during a burglary), but that "the most common motives for homicide are moralistic: retaliation after an insult, escalation of a domestic quarrel, punishing an unfaithful romantic partner, and other acts of jealousy, revenge and self-defence....Most homicides, Black notes, are really instances of capital punishment, with a private citizen as the judge, jury and executioner." (p. 83)

Pinker also disputes three commonly held theories of violence:
1. They are caused by a deficit of morality and justice
1. Violence is a disease
1. Poor people resort to violence out of financial need

He argues violence is caused by a "surfeit" of morality and justice, at least in the perpetrator's head, that he has been wronged; that a disease by definition causes harm to the individual, and that violent individual attack because they're angry at perceived injustices.

# Violence around the world

Quoting statistics from the World Health Organization's 2004 data set:

| Area | Homicide rate/100K/year |
| ---- | ----------------------- |
| World | 6 |
| United States | 5 |
| Europe | 3 |
| China | 2.2 |


p. 87

# Violence in the United States

Violence in the US nose-dived in the 1930s, skyrocketed in the 1960s, nosedived again in the 1990s.

Between 1976 and 2006 the average homicide rate for white Americans was 4.8, while the average rate for black Americans was 36.9. In the 1960s the rate of homicide for African Americans in NYC was 13x the rate of that of whites because, Pinker says, "African Americans were effectively stateless, relying on a culture of honor (sometimes called "the code of the streets") to defend their interests rather than calling in the law." (p. 98)

The South is consistently more violent than the North -- and not because it has more African Americans, southern African Americans are statistically more violent than northern ones -- but "the most sweeping answer is that the civilizing mission of government never penetrated the American South as deeply as it had in the Northeast." (p. 98-99) 

The West was especially violent because it was effectively stateless -- the CA gold rush of 1848 saw homicide rates of 83/100K (p. 103), it wasn't until an influx of women arrived that the West was tamed (p. 105).

# Decivilization in the 1960s

After a three-decade fall in violence in the U.S. from the Great Depression to post-WW2 the homicide rate more than doubled from 4 in 1957 to 10.2 in 1980 (p. 107). He disputes the theory that this was the result of the baby boom but the rise in violence (135%) doesn't match up with the increase in population (13%) (p. 108).

The first explanation Pinker reaches for is television, that baby boomers were the first generation to grow up with it and that this "common knowledge" led to a "horizontal web of solidarity that cut across the vertical ties to parents and authorities that had formerly isolated young people" (p. 109).

The second exogenous force he locates from sociologist Cas Wouters, who argued that the European Civilizing Process had run its course and was followed by a second wave he calld the *informalizing process*. Whereas the Civilizing Process had been a flow of manners downward from the upper class the rise of democracy and economic progress effectively unmoored the elites as perceived moral paragons and arbiters of taste (p. 110). Dress, speech and manner could be cultivated from mass media like television instead.

While breaking down old power structures may have served the long-term good it led to a short-term rise in violence, according to Pinker. Men abandoned institutions like marriage and traditional career roles (i.e. farmwork) to pursue sexual and economic freedom, and that this process hit the African American community particular hard because of pervasive racism among police and government authorities (p. 116).

# Recivilization in the 1990s

Even tho the homicide rate ballooned to 10.2/100K in 1980 it's still a 1/4 of the rate for Western Europe in 1450, 1/10th of the rate of the traditional Inuit and 1/50th the average rate of nonstate societies.

Theories of the crime decline Pinker disputes:
- Crack bubble of teenagers (crime fell among older groups too)
- Economic improvement (Canada's economy got worse but also experienced a decline)
- Legalized abortion in 1973 (proportion of children born to poor single black women did not decrease, it increased by a lot)

Pinker instead cites two forces:

> I think two overarching explanations are plausible. The first is that the Leviathan got bigger, smarter, and more effective. The second is that the Civilizing Process, which the counterculture had tried to reverse in the 1960s, was restored to its forward direction. (p. 121)

The rate of imprisonment in the U.S. had been steady from 1920-1960 but shot up almost 5x and today it's 2.3 million people or 0.7% (blacks have about a 28.5% chance of being carcerated while whites a 4.4% chance). A classic study of criminal records in Philly found that 6% of the young male population committed more than half the offenses. Incarceration beyond the most violent offenders has diminishing returns. (p. 123)

Another factor is the ballooning of police, in particular the addition of 100k police officers as part of the 1994 crime bill signed by Bill Clinton. Broken Windows theory of targeting minor offenses may have had an impact but it's hard to tell.

# The Humanitarian Revolution

Pinker summarizes the history of torture, which, as you might imagine, is not good, but pivots to the second half of the 18th century, the Enlightenment, or the Humanitarian Revolution, as a massive re-imagining of how humans treated each other.

Human sacrifice is ancient practice, recounted in the Bible (p. 134) and seen all across the world from the Aztecs to China, Sumeria, Egypt and Japan. Political scientist James Payne suggests ancient peoples put a low value on other people's lives because pain and death were so common in their own (p. 135). Died out on its own around 600-400 B.C. in most places.

Witchcraft is one of the most common motives for revenge among hunter-gather and tribal societies (p. 137). French and German witch-hunters killed between 60-100k witches (85% women) in the 16th and 17th centuries. Usually preceded by graphic torture. Witch hunting ended when states started to ban it.

Pinker singles out religion for de-humanizing out-group peoples as blasphemers, heretics and apostates who deserved violence (p. 139), and recounts the history of sanctioned Christian violence, along with some particularly graphic torture mechanisms.

One influential writer against barbarity was 18th century Milanese economist and social scientist Cesare Beccaria, whose 1764 bestseller *On Crimes and Punishments* argued the goal of a justice system should be to attain the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people, that punishment should be used as a deterrent and be proportional to the harm of the crime. The Vatican banned the book but over time his arguments became common wisdom (p. 148).

# Slavery

Between the 16th and 19th centuries at least 1.5 million Africans died in transatlantic slave ships (p. 153) and millions more perished in forced marches through jungles and deserts. At last 17 million (and perhaps as many as 65 million) died in the slave trade (p. 154).

The economic benefit of slaves has been debated for centuries but even Adam Smith in 1776 argued that slavery was inefficient because a slave would not be motivated to do any work beyond the bare minimum necessary since they had nothing to gain from it.
