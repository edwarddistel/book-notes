# The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined

(2011)

By Steven Pinker

## About the author

Steven Pinker is oe of America's leading public intellectuals.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pinker):

>  Pinker is a Canadian-American cognitive psychologist, linguist, and popular science author. He is an advocate of evolutionary psychology and the computational theory of mind.

> Pinker's academic specializations are visual cognition and psycholinguistics. His experimental subjects include mental imagery, shape recognition, visual attention, children's language development, regular and irregular phenomena in language, the neural bases of words and grammar, and the psychology of cooperation and communication, including euphemism, innuendo, emotional expression, and common knowledge. He has written two technical books that proposed a general theory of language acquisition and applied it to children's learning of verbs. In particular, his work with Alan Prince published in 1989 critiqued the connectionist model of how children acquire the past tense of English verbs, arguing instead that children use default rules such as adding "-ed" to make regular forms, sometimes in error, but are obliged to learn irregular forms one by one.

# Initial reaction

Clocking in at 696 pages, this information-dense, chart-heavy 2011 look at the decline of violence in human history is probably one of the most important works of nonfiction in the past 30 years. 

It's definitely not the first book to note the decline of violence but possibly the most comprehensive, surveying the work of dozens of academic fields, hundreds of scholarly books and articles all while writing in a vivid, conversational tone that never feels condescending or wonky.

# The numbers on the decline in violence

The title itself might come as a shock to most people -- considering world wars, the Holocaust, genocides and other horrors one might assume that the 21st century or at least the 20th cenutry might have been the bloodiest in human history.

You'd be wrong.

By a lot.

That can't be right, you say. Here's a cold, hard breakdown of the numbers:

> [Two new data sets] conservatively list about 40 million battle deaths during the 20th cenutry...If we consider that a bit more than 6 billion people died during the 20th century...we may estimate that around 0.7 percent of the world's population died in battles during that century. Even if we tripled or quadrupled the estimate to include indirect deaths from war-caused famine and disease, it would barely narrow the gap between state and nonstate societies. What if we added the deaths from genocides, purges and other man-made disasters? Matthew White, the atrocitologist we met in chapter 1, estimates that around 80 million deaths can be blamed on all of these human causes put together. That still amounts to only 3 percent of the deaths in the 20th century.

For hunter-gatherers the rate is around 13.4 percent, for city-dwellers before the modern era it was 2.7 percent.

For present day? Pinker estimates it's at a rate of 0.0003 percent.

As Pinker is quick to point out, the major difference maker is the state, which he calls "the Leviathian" (borrowing from 16th C English philosophy Thomas Hobbes), a theoretically neutral third party can establish justice and eliminate threats in the society.

# Why violence occurs

Pinker identifies three causes of violence:

1. Gain (predatory raids)
1. Safety (preemptive raids)
1. Reputation (retalitory raids)

The first two, Pinker argues (as have many before him), are typically perpetrated by state actors, but as modern well tends to be accrued not through occupying physical territory but through trade and the production of advanced goods and services, land wars become nonsensical, almost defeatist, since they destroy the modern means of wealth creation (people and economies).

The third category might actually be the biggest, and for that Pinker relies heavily in the book on the 1969 work of Norbert Elias *The Civilizing Process*. Elias, a Polish-German Jew who escaped the Holocaust, was the first major author to note the trend in the decline in violence in human history. Pinker writes:

> Elias's theory, then, attributes the decline in European violence to a larger psychological change...He proposed that over a span of several centuries, beginning in the 11th or 12th and maturing in the 17th and 18th, Europeans increasingly inhibited their impulses, anticipated the long-term consequences of their actions, and took other people's thoughts and feelings into consideration. A culture of honor...gave way to a culture of dignity...These ideals originated in explicit instructions that cultural arbiters gave to aristocrats and noblemen, allowing them to differentiate themsleves from the villains and boors. But they were then absorbed into the socialization of younger and younger children until they became second nature. The standards also trickled down from the upper classes to the bourgeoisie that strove to emulate them, and from them to the lower classes, eventually becoming a part of the culture as a whole.
