# How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking
(2014)

by Jordan Ellenberg

- Abraham Wald, a Romanian mathematician who pointed out that planes should be reinforced where there were no bullet holes, because those plane carcasses were never recovered; an example of seeing a problem lacks all possible choices

- Arthur Laffer, economics professor at U of C, drew on a napkin a curve for Rumsfeld and Cheney about ideal point of taxation; shape not a curve but the point was relationship between taxation and revenue is nonlinear

- Repeating 0.99999... decimal is equal to 1; proof: .33333... = 1/3; multiple both sides by 3 and .9 = 1; not exactly equal but falls short in an infinitesmal number

- A curve looks like a line if you zoom in on a small enough segment

- Law of Large Numbers: as the number of trials of a random process increases, the percentage difference between the expected and actual values goes to zero.

- Percentages are meaningless when values can possibly be negative; only make sense for positive values

- Baltimore Stockbroker scam: send out 10k letters, 5k predicting buy and 5k predicting sell; to the 5k that were correct, split in half again and predict both outcomes; after enough weeks to the few who got nothing but correct answers, offer to sell your picks

- In a 1994 paper to the Journal of Statistical Science, 3 Israeli authors looked for a "Bible Code" of rabbis names and birthdates in Genesis and "found" it; American journalist Michael Drosnin ran with it; but turns out they were using a selective list of names of rabbis, spelled differently the Hebrew War and Peace nailed the correlation

- At a 2009 conference neuroscientist Craig Bennett presented a paper where an MRI of a dead fish showed an ability to correctly assess the emotions of humans in photographs

- Null hypothesis ('this does nothing') significance test: compare your alternative hypothesis against the null, 0.05 the level

- Richard Feynman, a physics teacher, once said, "I saw one of the most amazing things on the way here tonight. You won't believe it, a license plate, with ARW 357 on it!"

- Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli in 1738 wrote about the "St Petersburg Paradox" where payout occurs on HEADS but compounds 100% on every throw, so 1 ducat on 1, 2 on 2, 4 on 3, 8 on 4, etc. In theory players should be willing to pay anything to play this game but few would, a problem in decision economics
